 * Class Table
 * 
 * This class is describing table in game, you

 * this class should behave like a real table
 * cards on table are sorted by unique identifier
 * of player, so you can get it really simple
 * this class is used when you are calling player
 * method putOnTable(), if you want to get cards
 * from player and there aren't any card this
 * action will throw an exception
